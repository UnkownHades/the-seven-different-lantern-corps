<h1>The Orange lantern</h1>
<h1>Larsfleeze</h1>
<p>The orange lanterns only consist of one because they are powered by greed there only member would never let anyone else join because his greed is so strong. So unlike the other lantern corps pages where I discussed their origin this the orange lantern corp but also the origin of Larfleeze there only member. Larfleeze the only member of the orange of the corp there can be other members but they are all ghost inside the orange lantern batter that Larsfleeze commands. According Larfleeze own account (which keep in mine could be not be true considering Larfleeze is kind of crazy) he was a part of a thieves guild in a group of five thieves they wanted to  be the best in there guild by pulling the ultimate heist. They decided to raid the planet to steal a box which supposedly had parallax the entity of fear in it and map to lead them to Krona a fallen guardian of universe. During this heist they lost one of their own. The map instead led them to a planet Okaara where they entered forbidden forest of weeds(thatâ€™s a really bad name.) Where another of their own died. The only 3 left Larfleeze, Turpa and Blooch fell into a temple where they discovered the orange lantern battery. They all became seduced by the orange light emitting from it and started fighting each other for the power battery. But then the guardians of universe arrived with the manhunters. But the orange light disable the manhunters and killed some of the guardians and Turpa. The guardians then appeared saying that all they want is the box containing parallax and that they can have the orange battery as long as it stayed in the temple but then they said only one could own the battery. With only Larfleeze and Baloch the two friends turned enemies start fighting over the orange battery. Larfleeze and became the new wielder of the battery and only orange lantern in the universe. There lantern oath is
    What's mine is mine and mine and mine.
    And mine and mine and mine!
    Not yours!"
